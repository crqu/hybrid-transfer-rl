Installation instructions:

```bash
$ conda create -n hybrid
$ conda activate hybrid
$ pip install rlberry@git+https://github.com/rlberry-py/rlberry.git
$ pip install git+https://github.com/rlberry-py/rlberry-research.git
```

Run visualization.ipynb for plotting the results.

The algorithms are implemented in the folder experiment/, the output data is stored in data/, the source environment data is generated by running experiment/generate $$_source_and_v_opt.ipynb.

- For experiment 1:
    - HySRL is implemented in experiment/hybrid-right-beta.py.
    
    ```bash
    $ python3 ./experiments/hybrid-right-beta.py
    ```
    
    - The results are stored in data/hybridreward.npy
    - BPI-UCBVI is implemented in experiment/online-right-beta.py
    
    ```bash
    $ python3 ./experiments/online-right-beta.py
    ```
    
    - The results are stored in data/onlinereward.npy
- For experiment 2:
    - HySRL is implemented in experiment/hybrid-wrong-beta.py
    
    ```bash
    $ python3 ./experiments/hybrid-wrong-beta.py
    ```
    
    - The results are stored in data/hybridopt-bar.npy
    - BPI-UCBVI is implemented in experiment/online-right-beta.py
    
    ```bash
    $ python3 ./experiments/online-wrong-beta.py
    ```
    
    - The results are stored in data/onlineopt-bar.npy
    - The optimal value functions when the real $\beta$ ranges from 0.05 to 0.4 is calculated by running experiment/generate_source_and_v_opt.ipynb.
